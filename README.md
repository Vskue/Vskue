## About me ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ

### Hi, I'm Victoria Kue! 
I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with a passion for finance. Currently, on my journey to mastering data analysis, particularly with R. 
I have a lovely cat named Luna who keeps me company during my studies. I'm excited to connect with others and share my learning experiences here on GitHub.
